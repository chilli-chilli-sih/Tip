# Funded Tip Distribution - Decentralized Tipping Platform

Funded Tip Distribution is a decentralized tipping platform designed to allow users to fund a contract and tip service providers using Ethereum smart contracts. The platform ensures transparent, secure, and trustless transactions while maintaining a fair and seamless experience for both providers and users.

## Features
- Fund the contract with ETH and send tips to providers.
- Secure tipping transactions using Ethereum smart contracts.
- Transparent and immutable transaction history on the blockchain.
- Easy integration with MetaMask for user wallet interactions.
- Real-time balance updates and transaction notifications.

## Contract Details
- Contract Address: 0x\<your_contract_address_here>
- Network: Ethereum Testnet (e.g., Sepolia or Mantle Sepolia)

## Deployment
- Contract Address: View on Explorer
- Coin Used: ETH (Sepolia Testnet ETH)

## How to Use

2. Fund Contract: Users can fund the contract with ETH to start tipping.
3. Send Tip: Users enter the providerâ€™s address and the tip amount to send ETH.
4. View Balance: Check the balance of the contract.

## Frontend
The frontend is designed to interact with the Funded Tip Distribution smart contract. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and connects to the Ethereum blockchain using the Web3.js library.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Deploy the smart contract to a test network.
3. Configure the frontend to interact with the deployed contract.
4. Connect MetaMask to fund the contract and send tips.

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-provider tipping to allow users to send tips to multiple providers.
- Real-time transaction history display for each user.
- Integration with IPFS to store provider information and transaction receipts.
- Implement a UI for users to easily track their funded contract balances and tips sent.
